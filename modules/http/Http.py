  Proxy for the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
</summary>
<description>
  <para>
    The Http module defines the classes constituting the proxy for the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is the protocol the Web is based on, therefore it is the most frequently used protocol on the Internet. It is used to access different kinds of content from the Web. The type of content retrieved via HTTP is not restricted, it can range from simple text files to hypertext files and multimedia formats like pictures, videos or audio files. 
  </para>
  <section>
    <title>The HTTP protocol</title>
    <para>
      HTTP is an open application layer protocol for hypermedia
      information systems. It basically allows an open-ended 
      set of methods to be applied to resources identified by
      Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Protocol elements</title>
      <para>
        HTTP is a text based protocol where a client sends a request
        comprising of a METHOD, an URI and associated meta information
        represented as MIME-like headers, and possibly a data attachment. 
        The server responds with a status code, a set of headers, and 
        possibly a data attachment. Earlier protocol versions perform a single
        transaction in a single TCP connection, HTTP/1.1 introduces
        persistency where a single TCP connection can be reused to perform
        multiple transactions.
      </para>
      <para>
        An HTTP method is a single word - usually spelled in capitals - 
        instructing the server to apply a function to the
        resource specified by the URI. Commonly used HTTP methods
        are "GET", "POST" and "HEAD". HTTP method names
        are not restricted in any way, other HTTP based protocols
        (such as WebDAV) add new methods to the protocol while
        keeping the general syntax intact.
      </para>
      <para>
        Headers are part of both the requests and the responses. Each
        header consists of a name followed by a colon (':') and a
        field value. These headers are used to specify
        content-specific and protocol control information.
      </para>
      <para>
        The response to an HTTP request starts with an HTTP status
        line informing the client about the result of the operation
        and an associated message. The result is represented by
        three decimal digits, the possible values are defined in the
        HTTP RFCs.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Protocol versions</title>
      <para>
        The protocol has three variants, differentiated by their
        version number. Version 0.9 is a very simple protocol which
        allows a simple octet-stream to be transferred without any
        meta information (e.g.: no headers are associated with requests
        or responses). 
      </para>
      <para>
        Version 1.0 introduces MIME-like headers in both requests
        and responses; headers are used to control both the
        protocol (e.g.: the "Connection" header) and to give
        information about the content being transferred (e.g.:
        the "Content-Type" header). This version has also introduced the
        concept of name-based virtual hosts.
      </para>
      <para>
        Building on the success of HTTP/1.0, version 1.1 of the
        protocol adds persistent connections (also referred to as
        "connection keep-alive") and improved proxy control.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Bulk transfer</title>
      <para>
        Both requests and responses might have an associated data blob, also
        called an entity in HTTP terminology. The size of the entity is determined
        using one of three different methods:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              The complete size of the entity is sent as a
              header (the Content-Length header).
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              The transport layer connection is terminated when transfer of the blob
              is completed (used by HTTP/0.9 and might be used in HTTP/1.1 in
              non-persistent mode).
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Instead of specifying the complete length, smaller chunks of
              the complete blob are transferred, and each chunk is prefixed
              with the size of that specific chunk. The end of the stream is
              denoted by a zero-length chunk. This mode is also called 
              chunked encoding and is specified by the Transfer-Encoding
              header.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

    <title>Proxy behavior</title>
      <para>
        The default low-level proxy implementation (<link linkend="python.Http.AbstractHttpProxy">AbstractHttpProxy</link>) denies all requests by default. Different requests and/or responses can be enabled by using one of the several predefined proxy classes which are suitable for most tasks. Alternatively, a custom proxy class can be derived from AbstractHttpProxy and the requests and responses enabled individually using different attributes.
      </para>
      <para>
      Several examples and considerations on how to enable virus filtering in the HTTP traffic are discussed in the 
        Technical White Paper and Tutorial <emphasis>Virus filtering in HTTP</emphasis>, available at the BalaBit Documentation Page <ulink url="http://www.balabit.com/support/documentation/">http://www.balabit.com/support/documentation/</ulink>.

      <section>
        <title>Transparent and non-transparent modes</title>
          <para>
            HttpProxy is able to operate both in transparent and non-transparent mode.
            In transparent mode, the client does not notice (or even know) that it is communicating through a proxy. The client communicates using normal server-style requests.
          </para>
          <para>
            In non-transparent mode, the address and
            the port of the proxy server must be set on the client.
            In this case the client sends proxy-style requests to the proxy.
          </para>
          <example>
            <title>Proxy style HTTP query</title>
            <literallayout>

&lt;/html&gt;

            </literallayout>
          </example>
        <para>
          In non-transparent mode it is possible to request the use of the SSL protocol through the proxy, which means the client communicates with the proxy using the HTTP protocol, but the proxy uses HTTPS to communicate with the server. This technique is called data tunneling.
        </para>

          Changing the default behavior of requests is possible using the
          <parameter>request</parameter> attribute. This hash is indexed by the HTTP method
          names (e.g.: GET or POST). The <parameter>response</parameter> attribute (indexed by the request method and the response code) enables the control of HTTP responses. The possible actions are described in the following tables. See also <xref linkend="proxy_policies"/>. When looking up entries of the <parameter>response</parameter> attribute hash, the lookup precedence described in <xref linkend="proxy_response_codes"/> is used.

          This example calls the filterURL function (defined in the example) whenever a HTTP GET request is received. If the requested URL is 'http://www.disallowedsite.com', the request is rejected and an error message is sent to the client.

        <title>Configuring policies for HTTP headers</title>
        <para>
          Both request and response headers can be modified by the proxy during
          the transfer. New header lines can be inserted, entries can be modified
          or deleted. To change headers in the requests and responses use the
          <parameter>request_header</parameter> hash or the <parameter>response_header</parameter> hash, respectively.
        </para>
        <para>
          Similarly to the request hash, these hashes are indexed by
          the header name (like "User-Agent") and contain an
          actiontuple describing the action to take.
        </para>
        <para>
          By default, the proxy modifies only the "Host", "Connection", "Proxy-Connection" and "Transfer-Encoding" headers. "Host" headers need to be changed when the proxy modifies the URL; "(Proxy-)Connection" is changed when the proxy turns connection keep-alive on/off; "Transfer-Enconding" is changed to enable chunked encoding.

          URLs or sets of URLs can be easily rejected or redirected to
          a local mirror by modifying some attributes during request
          processing.
        </para>
        <para>
          When an HTTP request is received, normative policy chains are processed
          (<parameter>self.request</parameter>, <parameter>self.request_header</parameter>). Policy callbacks for certain events can be configured with the HTTP_REQ_POLICY or HTTP_HDR_POLICY directives. Any of these callbacks may change the <parameter>request_url</parameter> attribute, instructing the proxy to fetch a page different from the one specified by the browser. Please note that this is transparent
          to the user and does not change the URL in the browser.

      <section>
        <title>Request types</title>
        <para>
          Zorp differentiates between two request types: server requests and proxy request. Server
          requests are sent by browsers directly communicating with HTTP
          servers. These requests include an URL relative to the server
          root (e.g.: /index.html), and a 'Host' header indicating which
          virtual server to use. 
        </para>
        <para>
          Proxy requests are used when the browser
          communicates with an HTTP proxy. These requests include a fully
          specified URL (e.g.: http://www.example.com/index.html).
        </para>
        <para>
          As there is no clear distinction between the two request types,
          the type of the request cannot always be accurately detected automatically, though all
          common cases are covered.
        </para>
        <para>
          Requests are handled differently in transparent and
          non-transparent modes. 
        </para>
        <para>
          A transparent HTTP proxy (<parameter>transparent_mode</parameter> attribute is TRUE) is
          meant to be installed in front of a network where clients do not
          know about the presence of the firewall. In this case the proxy
          expects to see server type requests only. If clients communicate
          with a real HTTP proxy through the firewall, proxy type requests
          must be explicitly enabled using the <parameter>permit_proxy_requests</parameter>
          attribute, or transparent mode has to be used.
        </para>
        <para>
          The use of non-transparent HTTP proxies (<parameter>transparent_mode</parameter>
          attribute is FALSE) must be configured in web browsers behind
          the firewall. In this case Zorp expects proxy requests only, and
          emits server requests (assuming <parameter>parent_proxy</parameter> is not set).
        </para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Using parent proxies</title>
        <para>
          Parent proxies are non-transparent HTTP proxies used behind Zorp. Two things have to be set in order to use parent proxies. First,
          select a router which makes the proxy connect to the
          parent proxy, this can be either InbandRouter() or
          DirectedRouter(). Second, set the <parameter>parent_proxy</parameter> and
          <parameter>parent_proxy_port</parameter> attributes in the HttpProxy class. Setting
          these attributes results in proxy requests to be emitted to the
          target server both in transparent and non-transparent mode.
        </para>
        <para>
          The parent proxy attributes can be set both in the
          configuration phase (e.g.: config() event), or later on a
          per-request basis. This is possible because the proxy re-connects.
        </para>
        <example>
          <title>Using parent proxies in HTTP</title>
          <para>In this example the MyHttp proxy class uses a parent proxy. For this the domain name and address of the parent proxy is specified, and a service using an InbandRouter is created.</para>

      <section>
        <title>FTP over HTTP</title>
        <para>
          In non-transparent mode it is possible to let Zorp process ftp://
          URLs, effectively translating HTTP requests to FTP requests on
          the fly. This behaviour can be enabled by setting
          <parameter>permit_ftp_over_http</parameter> to TRUE and adding port 21 to
          <parameter>target_port_range</parameter>. Zorp currently supports passive mode
          transfers only.
        </para>
      </section>  
      <section>
        <title>Error messages</title>
        <para>
          There are cases when the HTTP proxy must return an error page to
          the client to indicate certain error conditions. These error
          messages are stored as files in the directory specified by the
          <parameter>error_files_directory</parameter> attribute, and can be customized by
          changing the contents of the files in this directory. 
        </para>
        <para>
          Each file contains plain HTML text, but some special macros are
          provided to dynamically add information to the error page. The
          following macros can be used:

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>@INFO@</emphasis> -- further error information as provided by the proxy</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>@VERSION@</emphasis> -- Zorp version number</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>@DATE@</emphasis> -- current date</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis>@HOST@</emphasis> -- hostname of Zorp</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>                
          It is generally recommended not to display error messages to
          untrusted clients, as they may leak confidential information. To
          turn error messages off, set the <parameter>error_silent</parameter> attribute to TRUE, or 
          strip error files down to a minimum.

        <note>
          <para>
          The language of the messages can be set using the <parameter>config.options.language</parameter> global option, or individually for every Http proxy using the <parameter>language</parameter> parameter.
          See <xref linkend="appendix_globaloptions"/> for details.

        <title>Stacking</title>
        <para>
          HTTP supports stacking proxies for both request and response
          entities (e.g.: data bodies). This is controlled by the
          <parameter>request_stack</parameter> and <parameter>response_stack</parameter> attribute hashes. See also <xref linkend="proxy_stacking"/>.
        </para>
        <para>
          There are two stacking modes available: HTTP_STK_DATA sends only
          the data portion to the downstream proxy, while HTTP_STK_MIME also sends
          all header information to make it possible to process the data
          body as a MIME envelope. Please note that while it is possible to
          change the data part in the stacked proxy, it is not possible to
          change the MIME headers - they can be modified only by the HTTP proxy.
          The possible parameters are listed in the following tables.

                Allow server responses to use the limited HTTP/0.9 protocol.
                As these responses carry no control information, verifying
                the validity of the protocol stream is impossible. This does not
                pose a threat to web clients, but exploits might pass undetected
                if this option is enabled for servers.  It is recommended to turn this
                option off for protecting servers and only enable it when
                Zorp is used in front of users.

                Some clients send both a Connection and a Proxy-Connection

                kind of connection Zorp receives. This situation is

                this attribute to TRUE.

                fetched from the client. This attribute can be used to
                forcibly close a keep-alive connection.

                This attribute enables URL canonicalization, which means to
                automatically convert URLs to their canonical form. This
                enhances security but might cause interoperability problems
                with some applications. It is recommended to disable this
                setting on a per-destination basis. URL filtering still sees
                the canonicalized URL, but at the end the proxy sends the
                original URL to the server.

                Controls whether inband authentication information (username
                and password) should be forwarded to the upstream server. 
                When a parent proxy is present, the incoming authentication
                request is put into a 'Proxy-Authorization' header. In other 
                cases the 'WWW-Authorization' header is used.
