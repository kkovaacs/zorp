This is Zorp, welcome.
----------------------

Zorp is a new generation proxy firewall suite making it possible to finetune
proxy decisions (with its built in script language), to fully analyze
complex protocols (like SSH with several forwarded TCP connections), and to
utilize outband authentication techniques (unlike common practices where
proxy authentication had to be hacked into the protocol). 

Quickstarting Zorp
------------------

After installing zorp (described in the file INSTALL), you have to
come up with a policy.py file, which may not be the easiest thing to
do at first time. 

A sample policy file is provided named /etc/zorp/policy.py.sample to
be renamed to /etc/zorp/policy.py after local modifications are
applied.

You will need to modify the zone declaration (the beginning of the file),
to fit your network architecture. A zone in Zorp is a IP address range, and
is the basis of access control. Each zone may define the services which is
allowed to go into, and out of the zone.

As your policy file is in place, you'll need to add a new entry to your
$prefix/etc/zorp/instances.conf file, like this:

# excerpt from /etc/zorp/instances.conf
zorp_plug --policy /usr/local/etc/zorp/policy-plug.py

The first word is the instance name to start, and the rest are the
parameters to add to the zorp command line.

If you are done, you can now try to start your first Zorp instance using
zorpctl:

zorpctl start zorp_plug

if you leave the instance name empty, all instances are started. 

Documentation
